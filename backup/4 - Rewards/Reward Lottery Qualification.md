### Work in Progress

#### Mission statement
We want to be healthier in all the ways possible! So to start our main objective is to self track positive actions and give myself a point for them. If I reach 10 points by the end of the day I can do the reward thingy!

	- Read some book stuff
	- Blocked out instagram and other distracting apps all day
	- Went for a walk
	- Messaged a friend

### Who do I want to be?
- A joyful worker - I want work to bring me joy. So when I think of work I want to think of it joyfully this applies to more than just work work.
- Physically healthy - life is more fun and has more opportunities with a body that is well nourished and maintained.

- Kind - Life is filled with horrible things. I will likely or am likely participating in many of them. At the same time though I can consciously do my best to find ways to help and give comfort, joy, and love to those around me.
- Financially Independent - I would like to be at a point where work is more of something I get to do rather than something I have to do. The end goal here is that if work were gone I would have the resources to support myself and those I care for. This includes diversification of assets but explicitly excludes doomsday prepping
