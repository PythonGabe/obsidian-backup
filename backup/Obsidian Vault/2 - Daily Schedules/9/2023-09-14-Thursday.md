- Hurray you have made it to the future! We are here together. I am proud? **y**/n
	- Lets reflect on why we feel that way.
		- I follow through on most of my daily tasks
		- I made plans for the future.
		- I slept well last night
	- Also lets reflect on what things I avoided.
		- What things distracted me.
			- I watched more naruto than planned
			- I scrolled reddit and distracted myself when I felt overwhelmed
	- Reflections on planning
		- Planning events took away from scheduled work time
		- Manual labor tasks take longer than planned usually
		- Goals/Things I want to get done
			- Break down day into blocks (2 hr)
				- What goals will I be working on in this block
			- At the start of each block there is reflection/plan phase
		- Planning out { blocks } of the day seems to be helpful
		- I liked having a planned out morning that allowed for me to have time to get up
		- I like when I can check things off even if they are small
	- How do I feel at this point in the day? good
		- I still feel behind on EMP stuff.
		- It would be smart for me to get the staging stuff (done) tonight
		- It would be smart for me to have the REPO started
		- It would be smart for me to have the documentation for Github Releases Either Updated or reviewed today
