First we have to acknowledge that we aren't focused. If we have done that then hopefully we find our selves here. Below is a process that might help. To be honest I am making it up write now off the top of my head but it will be awesome!

1. Ask yourself what is that we want to focus on and why?
2. Is there something specific that is causing us to drift?
3. Could it be a fear of failure?
4. Anyway stuff like that. If we can truly understand why we are unfocused and what instead has our attention. We can evaluate if we need to address the distractor first.

Tips
- Write what you want to focus on down.
	- Set a timer for 1 minute and attempt to focus on the thing.
	- After the timer goes off do a quick mental eval.
		- Were we focusing on what we wanted?
			- Perfect - set the timer to 1 minute more and repeat.
		- if not what distracted us?
			- decide if that distraction is more important than the focus goal
			- if not repeat the timer.
